All your music are belong to us

# Credits

I am a big fan of the great curated playlist over at http://vip.aersia.net by Cat777. The technology behind it is dated (Flash) and some features were missing - therefore this `game-music-player` came to be. Thanks again to Cat777 for giving out their playlist and support this project ✌️.

`game-music-player` uses GoogleAnalytics to track the usage of the different features and how they can be improved as a product. Apart from being completely transparent and open-sourced, `game-music-player`'s goal is **not** collecting data.
