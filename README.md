# Game Music Player

A open-source music player that uses the latest üî• web technology.
A playlist I enjoyed a lot to listen to during work (read more in the [credits](#credits) section) inspired me to start this project. This way it can be extended and improved while experimenting latest techs and learn from it.

Would be great if this project can grow to a well implemented PWA built with [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) that does one thing well and decreases the gap for other developers to start/bootstrap their own.


## Contribution

Contributions can be suggestions, PRs, feature requests or even code review!

To get started simply:
- `yarn` or `npm install`
- `ionic serve`
- start hacking away!


## Credits

I am a big fan of the great curated playlist over at http://vip.aersia.net by Cat777. The technology behind it is dated (Flash) and some features were missing - therefore this `game-music-player` came to be. Thanks again to Cat777 for giving out their playlist and support this project ‚úåÔ∏è.


## Privacy

`game-music-player` uses GoogleAnalytics to track the usage of the different features and how they can be improved as a product. Apart from being completely transparent and open-sourced, `game-music-player`'s goal is **not** collecting data.
